## Universal Chapter Structure

**EVERY A-grade dissertation follows this pattern:**

### Chapter 1: Introduction
**Always includes:**
- **Motivation/Motivations** — Why this matters
- **Aims/Goals** — What the project will achieve

**Often includes:**
- Summary/Outline of chapters
- Problem statement

**Page count:** 2-4 pages

### Chapter 2: Background
**Always includes:**
- Domain-specific concepts
- Related/Existing work
- Technologies/Methods used

**Often includes:**
- Summary at end of chapter

**Page count:** 5-12 pages

### Chapter 3: Analysis/Requirements
**Usually includes:**
- User scenarios/personas
- User stories
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements

**Sometimes called:** Requirements Gathering, Problem Specification

**Page count:** 3-6 pages

### Chapter 4: Design
**Covers:**
- System architecture
- Design decisions
- Data structures
- Algorithms chosen

**Page count:** 4-8 pages

### Chapter 5: Implementation
**Covers:**
- Technical details
- Tools and libraries
- Code structure
- Challenges faced

**Page count:** 4-8 pages

### Chapter 6: Evaluation
**Covers:**
- Experimental setup
- Results
- Metrics
- Comparison with baselines

**Page count:** 5-10 pages

### Chapter 7: Discussion (sometimes combined with Evaluation)
**Covers:**
- Interpretation of results
- Comparison with literature
- Limitations
- Future work

**Page count:** 3-6 pages

### Chapter 8: Conclusion
**Covers:**
- Summary of achievements
- Key contributions
- Final remarks

**Page count:** 1-2 pages

## Key Observations

### 1. Introduction Pattern
**ALL 14 dissertations** have Motivation in the Introduction:
- "Motivation" or "Motivations" as first subsection
- Immediately establishes WHY this matters
- Often includes real-world impact

### 2. Background Depth
Successful backgrounds include:
- Clear definitions of key terms
- Survey of existing products/approaches
- Gap identification (what's missing)
- Technical foundations needed

### 3. Requirements Are Explicit
Most include explicit requirements:
- Functional: "The system shall..."
- Non-functional: Performance, usability, etc.
- Derived from user scenarios

### 4. Evaluation is Substantial
- Multiple evaluation methods
- Quantitative metrics
- User studies where applicable
- Comparison with baselines

### 5. Critical Discussion
High-scoring dissertations:
- Don't just report results
- Critically analyse what worked/didn't
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Suggest concrete future work

## Page Count Guidelines

| Type | Range | Sweet Spot |
|------|-------|------------|
| Joint Honours | 36-71 | ~45 pages |
| Single Honours | 40-142 | ~55 pages |

**For Nile (Single Honours, 40 page limit):**
Aim for ~38-40 pages of content.

## Structure Comparison: Research vs Implementation

### Implementation-Heavy Projects (most examples)
1. Introduction
2. Background
3. Analysis/Requirements
4. Design
5. Implementation
6. Evaluation
7. Conclusion

### Research-Heavy Projects (like Nile's)
1. Introduction
2. Background
3. **Methodology** (replaces Analysis/Requirements + Design)
4. **Implementation** (shorter, focused on pipeline)
5. **Results** (replaces Evaluation)
6. **Discussion** (more substantial)
7. Conclusion
