## From NHS Overview

**Key points from NHS page:**
- Depression is more than feeling unhappy for a few days
- Persistent sadness for weeks or months
- "Real illness with real symptoms" - not weakness
- Can range from mild to severe
- Can involve physical symptoms (tiredness, sleep problems, no appetite)
- With right treatment, most people can make full recovery

**Causes:**
- Life-changing events (bereavement, job loss, childbirth)
- Family history
- Can occur without obvious reason

**Treatment options:**
- Mild: watchful waiting, lifestyle changes (exercise), self-help, CBT
- Moderate-severe: talking therapy + antidepressants
- Severe: specialist mental health team referral

## Why AI/Automated Detection Could Help

### Current Problems:
1. **Stigma** - people reluctant to seek help
2. **Access** - limited mental health services, long waiting lists
3. **Subjectivity** - diagnosis relies on self-report and clinician judgment
4. **Early detection** - often diagnosed late when symptoms are severe
5. **Monitoring** - difficult to track changes over time

### What AI Speech Analysis Could Offer:
1. **Objective markers** - not reliant on self-report
2. **Non-invasive** - uses natural speech, no special equipment
3. **Scalable** - could screen large populations
4. **Continuous monitoring** - track changes over time
5. **Early intervention** - detect before crisis
6. **Reduce clinician burden** - triage tool
7. **Privacy** - could be done on-device

## Global Statistics (WHO 2024)

**Source:** WHO Fact Sheet on Depression - https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression

### Prevalence
- **5.7% of adults** globally suffer from depression
- **4% of total population** experience depression
- **332 million people** worldwide have depression
- Women: 6.9% vs Men: 4.6% (1.5x more common in women)
- Adults 70+: 5.9%
- Over 10% of pregnant/postpartum women experience depression

### Treatment Gap
- **In high-income countries, only ~1/3 of people with depression receive treatment**
- Barriers: lack of investment, lack of trained providers, social stigma

### Suicide
- **727,000 deaths by suicide** in 2021
- Suicide is **3rd leading cause of death** in 15-29 year olds

## UK-Specific Statistics (To Complete)

Need to find from APMS 2023/4:
- [ ] UK adult prevalence rate
- [ ] Number of people affected in UK
- [ ] NHS costs / economic burden
- [ ] Treatment rates in UK
- [ ] Waiting times for services

## The Case for Automated Detection

### Current Problems (for Motivation section):
1. **Only 1/3 receive treatment** even in high-income countries
2. **Stigma** prevents help-seeking
3. **Limited services** - not enough trained mental health providers
4. **Subjective diagnosis** - relies on self-report and clinical interview
5. **Late detection** - often diagnosed when symptoms are severe
6. **No objective biomarkers** - unlike many physical conditions

### What Speech-Based Detection Could Offer:
1. **Objective measurement** - not reliant on self-report or recall
2. **Non-invasive** - uses natural speech, no blood tests or imaging
3. **Low cost & scalable** - could be deployed via smartphone apps
4. **Continuous monitoring** - track changes over time (unlike episodic clinic visits)
5. **Early intervention** - detect subtle changes before clinical presentation
6. **Reduce stigma** - framed as "wellness check" rather than mental health screening
7. **Triage tool** - help clinicians prioritize who needs immediate attention
8. **Remote access** - can screen people who can't access in-person services

## Notes

The APMS 2023/4 survey results should have the most up-to-date UK-specific data. Need to access the actual report for precise statistics.

Mental Health Foundation may have infographics and key statistics in digestible format.
