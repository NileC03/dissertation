**Student:** Nile  
**University:** University of Glasgow, 4th Year Computer Science  
**Supervisor:** TBD  

---

## Key Requirements (from Glasgow CS guidance)

### Format
- **Page limit:** 40 pages (excludes front matter, appendices, bibliography)
- **Template:** Must use provided LaTeX template (l4proj.cls)
- **Font/margins:** Cannot be altered (10pt default)
- **Citation style:** Harvard (agsm) - default in template

### Assessment Breakdown
- **85%** Dissertation
- **10%** Professional Conduct
- **5%** Presentation (10-15 min)

### Dissertation Structure (recommended)
1. **Introduction** - Why should reader care? What are you doing?
2. **Background** - What have others done? How is it relevant?
3. **Analysis/Requirements** - What problem are you solving? How did you arrive at it?
4. **Design** - Abstract approach (language/tool agnostic)
5. **Implementation** - Technical achievements, high-level first then details
6. **Evaluation** - How good is the solution? Evidence-based
7. **Conclusion** - Summary for lazy reader, future work

### Abstract Formula
> Motivate → Set aims → Describe work → Explain results

### Key Writing Rules
- Reader is a trained CS professional - don't explain basics
- Motivate clearly - reader doesn't know why they should care
- Be precise and accurate
- No personal discussions ("I chose Java because I like it")
- No brain dumps or chronological reports
- Present a logical argument, not "one damn thing after another"

## Project-Specific Plan

### Research Dissertation Focus (per advisor)
This is a **research dissertation first and foremost**.

#### Motivation Section Must Cover:
1. Commercial availability - What tools exist?
2. Current approaches - What are researchers doing?
3. UK statistics - How many affected by depression?
4. The need - Why do we need AI tools for this?

#### Technical Foundation:
1. What is speech? (formal definition)
2. How do you measure differences in speech?
3. What statistical methods exist?
4. Be formal and precise

### Data
- Using existing datasets (no ethics approval needed)
- ANDROIDS corpus already identified
- Other datasets to research

## Tonight's Research Tasks (Feb 1, 2026)

### 1. Literature Review - Depression Detection via Speech
- [ ] Survey commercial tools (if any exist)
- [ ] Map key academic papers (last 5-10 years)
- [ ] Identify key speech features used (acoustic, prosodic, temporal)
- [ ] Statistical/ML methods commonly employed

### 2. UK Depression Statistics
- [ ] Prevalence data (NHS, mental health charities)
- [ ] Healthcare burden
- [ ] Barriers to diagnosis (why AI could help)

### 3. Speech Features Taxonomy
- [ ] Acoustic features (pitch, energy, formants, MFCCs)
- [ ] Prosodic features (rhythm, stress, intonation)
- [ ] Temporal features (pauses, speech rate)
- [ ] Linguistic features (if applicable)

### 4. Dataset Survey
- [ ] ANDROIDS corpus - detailed review
- [ ] DAIC-WOZ dataset
- [ ] Other relevant corpora
