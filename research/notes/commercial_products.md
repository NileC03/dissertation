# Commercial Products: Voice-Based Mental Health Detection

There ARE commercial products in this space, though the field is still emerging. Most are B2B (selling to healthcare providers/insurers) rather than direct-to-consumer.

## Market Landscape Summary

### What Exists:
1. **B2B APIs** for healthcare providers (Kintsugi, Winterlight)
2. **Clinical trial tools** for pharma companies
3. **Call center integration** for screening
4. **Research platforms** (limited clinical deployment)

### What Doesn't Exist (Gaps):
1. No widely deployed **consumer screening apps** (yet)
2. No **NHS-approved** voice-based depression screening
3. Limited **standalone diagnostic tools** (all positioned as "complementary")
4. No **UK-specific** commercial products identified

### Regulatory Status:
- Most positioned as "wellness" or "screening" tools, not diagnostics
- FDA clearance/approval status varies
- CE marking for Europe unclear for most

## Implications for Dissertation

### Answering Advisor's Question: "Is there anything commercially available?"

**Answer:** Yes, but limited:
- Kintsugi is the most prominent (multiple awards, API available)
- Most products are B2B, not consumer-facing
- No products are approved as standalone diagnostic tools
- All are positioned as "complementary" to clinical judgment
- No widespread NHS/UK healthcare deployment

### This Creates an Angle:
- Gap between research capabilities (81% accuracy per meta-analysis) and clinical deployment
- Opportunity to explore why this gap exists (regulation, validation, trust, etc.)
- UK-specific implementation considerations
